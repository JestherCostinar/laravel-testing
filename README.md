## Laravel Testing

To run laravel test, the command is:
```
php artisan test
```
 - It will run the feature and Unit test

## Difference Between Feature Test and Unit Test
- <strong>Feature Test</strong> - Most of the project test is feature test, which means test the feature whether it will work and not.
- <strong>Unit Test</strong> - Are more about unit of the code. example is test the function of the code whether it will work correction. function is 1 unit of project.

## Unit Tests
The purpose of unit test is to test the small portion or unit of your code. Example is function/method.

To create unit test, the command is: 
```
php artisan make:test CurrencyTest --unit
```

## Run Specific Test
To execute specific test, the command is: 
```
php artisan test --filter="Testfilename"
```

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a way of doing the testing first before the actual code. It's like thinking all the possible scenario first and test it before doing it in actual coding.
